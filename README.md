# AirWarfare
AirWarfare is a 2D plane game made in python using the pygame library.
I've made this game in a hurry for school presentation. It's not the best and quality of code is debatable.
I'd love to hear any feedback

## New Radio
Newly added radio you can add your own songs into `data\Sound\Radio` (if you dont have this folder add it) and the cycle  
between them using CTRL + LEFT ARROW/RIGHT ARROW and change volume using CTRL + MOUSE SCROLL

## Experimental feature
for planes that are low health (<200hp) there are explosions to indicate fire you can turn this feature on in `data\Settings\Game.json`
